        ============================
        Python bindings to oDesk API
        ============================
        
        This is a Python bindings for Public oDesk API http://developers.odesk.com/
        Using the API you can build apps that will help you:
        
        * Mangage your distributed team
        * Search for contractors and jobs
        * Send bulk invitations to interview and make offers
        * Send bulk messages to your team
        * Retrieve Time & Financial information for your company, team and contractors
        
        API is the best way to comunicate between apps.
        
        
        Requirements
        ============
        httplib2>=0.8
        oauth2>=1.5.211
        urllib3>=1.7
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
            pip install python-odesk
        
        All the dependencies will be automatically installed as well.
        
        
        SSL Certificates Note
        =====================
        Unfortunately SSL certificates for oDesk are not included in the ``httplib==0.8``.
        
        Threrefore if you use Debian/Ubuntu/Archlinux,
        we recomend to install a package ``httplib2.system_ca_certs_locater``::
        
            pip install pbr httplib2.system_ca_certs_locater
        
        It will force ``httplib2`` to use the OS's certificates file.
        
        Another option is to create a ``ca_certs_locater.py`` in your projects directory
        and following the example from https://github.com/dreamhost/httplib2-ca_certs_locater
        load patched ``ca_certs.txt`` file.
        
        You can find patched ``ca_certs.txt`` here:
        https://github.com/kipanshi/odesk_meter/blob/master/lib/httplib2/cacerts.txt
        
        
        Quickstart
        ==========
        First, you need to create API key for authorization here:
        https://www.odesk.com/services/api/keys
        
        Installing **Ipython** interactive shell is very useful for playing
        with the API, it has autocomplete, history, displays docstring help if you add '?'
        to the end of variable/function/class/method and many other nice things.
        So we greatly encourage you to install it: ``pip install ipython``
        
        To get started, look at the docs http://odesk.github.io/python-odesk/how_to.html
        and also look at the ``examples/`` folder to see examples how to
        obtain oauth access tokens for web application and desktop application.
        
        Also threre's a list of opensource projects using ``python-odesk``:
        
        * oDesk Meter https://github.com/kipanshi/odesk_meter
        * oDesk Graphs https://github.com/demalexx/odesk-graphs
